''' learn pytorch 

data can be any things (images , videos , audio , dna ,etc)
machine learning is a game of  two parts 
1 .  get a data into a numerical representation .
2 .  buils a model to learn pattern in data 

input( data : images , text , audio , etc)
then we have to create some sort of numerical encoding mean we
have to convert that data in to numerical in order to find pattens from that data 

then we have to build some sort of neural network which learn representation (patterns / features / weights)
with in that numerical encoding 

build a model or use pretrained model to find ptterns itto data 

representation of that output  :
it can be image classification , text classification , computer vision ,

1 ) REGRESSION ANALYSIS 
Y = dependend variable 
f = function 
x = iependend variable 
beta or b = unknown parameters or slope channge in x leads to change in y
e = errors terms 

y = f(x, b) + e
or 
y = a+bx
a = is itercept (when y is something x= 0)


to showcase this lets create some data usinfg the liner regression formula
we'll use a liner regression fromula to make a stright line with known paremeters
